# GNU AUTOTOOLS SHAREABLE DYNAMIC MODULE PROJECT
# DRE 2017

This is the test project dynamic module GNU autotools exemplar to explain by doing a small simple project that
uses autotools to construct a working, complete program dynamically loading a shared library module 
and executing code within it. 

The property herein remains in right of the original owners with whatever terms they deemed fit to demand. All I did was analyze many conflicted and
incomplete technical sources (see attached .pdf files for examples) and make them work. It's what I do.

If my 5 hours of work saves you one, please pass that time on. Hug your kids.
